# About Covid-19

Just for the sake of use, I recommend using a virtualenv with python version 3.7.2 :)

This script, being a test, is just interacting in the terminal.

Let's go!

First step, run the following commands to add the lib

``` pip install pandas ```

``` pip install bs4 ```

``` pip install lxml ```

After that, just run the command python or python3 covid.py

**This is the initial idea, but I am open to suggestions for improvements and possible cases and use**
